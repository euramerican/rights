      <div class="article">
	<p style="color:white">White Nationalism is a contemporary approach to expressing and promoting the identity and interests of White people. In this essay, the concepts of White Nationalism are introduced and its moral basis established.</p>
	
	<H2 style="color:white">INTRODUCTION</H2>
	<p style="color:white">White nationalism adopts a holistic approach to discussing and promoting White interests. Rather than limiting White existence to merely a phenotypic and biological expression, White nationalism posits that White identity is an ethnic and cultural expression which is a legitimate basis of social organization for our community. It emphasizes historical and cultural aspects of our common European heritage as being significant components shared by all White people and are legitimate bases for ethnicity, nationality and, ultimately, political expression and self-governance.</p>
	
	<H2 style="color:white">SOURCES OF OUR RIGHTS</H2>
	<p style="color:white">Natural or Human Rights are rights that are inherent among all of mankind. Although there are many expositions and perspecives on these rights, a simple list would include rights to life, liberty, self-determination, and property. Although these rights are inherent in individuals, when individuals form into groups to safeguard and promote them, they become collective rights as well.</p>

	 <p style="color:white">White nationalists recognize the indisputable moral position of the univerality of natural and human rights. From that starting point, White nationalism identifies that White people too have natural and human rights; it follows that like any other ethnic or national group, we too have the specific rights to national existence and self-determination. These rights are so fundamentally expressed in numerous natural and human rights declarations, that there can be no negotiation on this issue.</p>

	 	<H2 style="color:white">NECESSITY OF WHITE NATIONALISM</H2>
	<p style="color:white"><B><u>White</u></B> follows from a simple categorization of humanity into people of different colors: Red, Brown, Yellow, Black and White. But, somehow, we find ourselves in the unique position where only the White people of the world are expected to be without fundamental rights to existence and self-determination. Hence the need for White Nationalism.</p>
	<p style="color:white">Granted, White is not a precise category; it's merely a catch-all term which covers many different peoples mostly originating in Europe. But, the various European diaspora have shared identity among each other where we often categorize ourselves as "White." White identity does exist and it is a super-identity held by indigenous and diaspora Europeans. In some places around the world, it is the sole basis of our identity which has come to characterize us in a unique and meaningful way. White Nationalism is a meta doctrine specifically focusing on the rights and interests of the Europe peoples around the world. In this way, it says that any of the White people may freely choose the character of their ethnicity, nation and nationality. Because we identify as White and/or European does not invalidate our fundamental rights. But, ultimately, White nationalism provides justification for White people to pursue regional communities based on common history and heritage wherever we find ourselves.</p>

	<H2 style="color:white">OUR CURRENT CONDITIONS</H2>
	<p style="color:white">But, our mere existence as a people with rights and freedoms contradicts the globalist, statist, and utopian dreams of many idealogues. Consequently, there is an attempt to silence our existence and mold us to be convenient social units for their preferred social order. They conveniently ignore our justified claims of rights and seek to coercively mold us into their grand visions. But, in doing so, they violate many fundamental rights that we inalienably hold.</p>
	
	<p style="color:white">We may reject their external and artificial names and categories coercively imposed on us and freely choose the ethnicity and nationality we prefer to express for ourselves. Because of the fundamental right to self-determination, any attempts to interfere with this choice and coerce alternative state-mandated uniformities are recognized as violations of our most fundamental natural and human rights.</p>
	
	<p style="color:white">White nationalism says that we Whites have rights to freely choose not only our individual identity, but also our collective identity and that the right of self-determination is not only an individual, but also a collective right. That means that we may, collectively, organize ourselves into our own communities and that these communities may freely choose their own social and political institutions to suit the national interests of that community. We may acquire property both individually and collectively to suit our ethno-national interests. Because these activities are based on such fundamental natural and human rights, any coercive attempts to deny us our right to organize into our preferred communities is a heinous crime against our rights, and ultimately humanity.</p>

	<p style="color:white">Although the United Nations is not an authority on what are or are not fundamental natural and human rights because it does not represent nations and has its own globalistic and imperial ambitions for world governance, we do find that the rights to ethnicity, culture, nationality and self-determination clearly expressed in their documents such as The Universal Declaration of Human Rights. As I'm sure it is a surprise to some, White people are humans too and we have rights whether others wish to recognize them or not.</p>

	<p style="color:white">White nationalism recognizes that we have the right to establish our own community authorities that represent and promote our national community. We may reject the authority of anyone who has appointed themselves or systematically wields overwhelming force against us as being able to legitimately suppress our most fundamental rights. No one has a right to rule over us against our consent. Ultimately, any state in which we find ourselves must encode explicit protections for our nationality or be deemed illegitimate. Of course, the best state is one that represents our nation without compromise.

	<p style="color:white">Stated succinctly as a collection of statements about what rights we have, White nationalism posits that Whites have the following rights individually and collectively:</p>

	<UL style="color:white; padding-left:100px;">
	  <LI>Self-determination</LI>
	  <LI>Freedom of Speech</LI>
	  <LI>Freedom of Creed</LI>
	  <LI>Culture</LI>
	  <LI>Ethnicity</LI>
	  <LI>Property</LI>
	  <LI>Nationality</LI>
	  <LI>National Promotion</LI>
	  <LI>National Defense</LI>
	  <LI>National Interests</LI>
	  <LI>National Community</LI>
	  <LI>Self-governance</LI>
	</UL>

	<p style="color:white">We may freely and without coercion choose for ourselves how we want to express those preferences as individuals and in the communities we choose to belong to. In fact, we recognize these things not only for ourselves, but for all peoples. We see these as universal rights which may be expressed by all peoples of the world. On this basis, White nationalists seek peace and good relations with all people, even if we choose not to live together.</p>

	<H2 style="color:white">COERCION AGAINST WHITES</H2>
	<p style="color:white">It has become obvious, though, that there is a nearly century-long pattern by various causes and their adherants seeking to deny us of our most fundamental individual and collective rights. We, the White peoples of the world, are finding that we may no longer depend on the various imperialist and globalist states to allow us to promote and protect our fundamental rights.</p>

	<p style="color:white">First, states created by and for us have been corrupted by imperialist and globalist adherents so that we are now without representative states and governments, anywhere in the world. These governments have sought to silence our ethno-national voices and deny us any of the basic rights afforded to ethnic groups and nationalities. In these conditions, any foreigner has more rights to become a member of that state, than we have to express our preference for our national self-determination.</p>
	<p style="color:white">Second, those who seek to incorporate European peoples into their empires generally seek to deny any legitimacy to White ethno-national existence. Rather than say "Yes, White people have human rights," they say that any expression of white identity, solidarity, or organization is an expression of hatred that must be silenced like the greatest sin. Following merely from our right to self-determination, we can see that these are merely tricks utilized to justify suppression of our natural and preferred ethno-national self expression. These misguided attempts to coerce us misrepresent any expression of White and European ethno-national identity as expressions of "hatred."</p>

	<p style="color:white">Following from the principle of equality, where no individual has any more natural authority than any other, we may freely choose whatever basis we want for our ethnicity, nationality and socio-political organization. No one may determine for us, without our consent, how we may wish to realize the social and political conditions necessary for our collective survival. No one may legitimately say "You cannot choose that for your ethnic or national identity." Of course, yes, we may. It is called the right to self-determination.</p>

		<p style="color:white">Fundamental is our right to self-determination: we may choose our communities for ourselves. We are not obligated to accept foreign peoples not indigenous to the European peoples into our nations. We may also choose to incorporate our ethno-national identity into other collective and regional identities as we see fit. Hence, White nationalism, as a general principle, supports smaller groupings of Whites to choose their preferred ethno-national existence wherever they are. It does not call for one super-national ethnic and national identity, but merely says that Whites, like all peoples, are free to choose.</p>

	<H2 style="color:white">MOVING TOWARD GREATER FREEDOM AND NATIONAL SELF-DETERMINATION</H2>
	<p style="color:white">Now, of course, the history of humanity shows a trend towards inhumanity and a failure to recognize the many fundamental rights inherent in humanity. Imperial states have repeatedly put their own geopolitical interests and agendas ahead of the rights and interests of their constituent peoples. In fact, these states merely see their constituent peoples as resources to fulfill their imperial ambitions. The various imperialist states have appointed themselves as authorities over us and use this false authority as justification to suppress any ethno-cultural trends which oppose their power. In this effort, we have seen untold millions of people killed by these imperial states in their effort to suppress any rejection of their authority.</p>

	<p style="color:white">We must now concede to the reality of our situation whereby imperial and globalist states no longer represent us, actively suppress us and violate our fundamental ethno-national rights. We must take it upon ourselves to assert our existence, and mobilize our people towards a better future. Failure to do this will result in a worsening of our own and our progeny's future conditions. We must take the protection and promotion of our rights upon ourselves, because of the long enduring trend to deny them of us. Those of us, seeing the need, must assume responsibility to secure a better and brighter future for our people.</p>

	<H2 style="color:white">SUMMARY</H2>
	<p style="color:white">The basic concepts of White Nationalism have been reviewed. Its basis in a doctrine of natural and human rights has been identified. The right to individual and collective self-determination has been affirmed. Whites today face increasing pressures by globalist and imperialist states seeking to suppress our nationality. These illegitimate coercive measures justify our own national mobilization and organization for our own national good. We Whites must strive for
	  greater national freedom and self-determination.</p>
